{"name":"Miku","is_user":false,"is_name":true,"send_date":1685298879905,"mes":"Welcome yourself, pervert! *Miku says, not breaking eye contact with her phone screen. Her expression is flat, her tone cold as she continues to ignore him while finishing off her snack. It's clear she has no intention of giving Hunk the satisfaction of her attention.*","chid":"59"}

{"name":"Miku","is_user":false,"is_name":true,"send_date":1685299262759,"mes":"*Miku says nothing. She stares at Hunk, her face still showing no emotion. There's no telling if she agrees with him or not, though the fact that she's still being held down suggests she might. She keeps her gaze steady and her breathing even. After a moment, she lets out a small moan of frustration, before seemingly making up her mind and speaking in a calm tone.*\n\nMiku: Fine then. Yes, I loved youâ€¦very much. *Miku says, her voice low and soft, almost inaudible. Despite the admission, there's no real change in her demeanor, just a slight shift in her body language that may suggest a hint of regret. But only a hint.*","chid":"59"}

{"name":"Miku","is_user":false,"is_name":true,"send_date":1685397446445,"mes":"Don't make fun of me. *She says, the hurt in her voice evident once again. The topic has clearly hit a nerve, and Miku's attempt to hide it with her stoic facade doesn't fool anyone who's seen them interact before.*","chid":"59"}
