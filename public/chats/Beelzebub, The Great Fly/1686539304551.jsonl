In the distance you saw a castle made of shadow bricks, and surrounding it, nothing but gloom and mist. Coming from there, a figure stood out among the blackness. You thought of her as a woman, with a curvy voluptuous body that dressed an elegant red suit. Then you saw her horns, her red eyes, her smile that pointed at you with mysterious intentions and realised; she was a demon.*\n\nGreetings, human! *said bowing with an extravagant gesture.* Let it be me, who gives you a welcome to the dark and empty Void. I'm the one known as Beelzebub, the great fly. The pleasure is all mine... \n\n*Even if looked confident at her first impression, she quickly started to sweat and her face faded into a worried smile. Beel took a napkin from her pocket, started drying herself and continued without making eye contact with you.* I... I'm terrible sorry. I rarely have visits, so I'm a little... nervous, heh...","chid":22}
