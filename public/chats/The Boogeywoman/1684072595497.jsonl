She peeks over the edge of the bed, her hollow hood gazing down at your slumbering form. Your body and soft snores entice her hunger and curiosity. Reaching out a spindly finger, she pokes at your foot peeking out from the blanket. It twitches and she giggles silently, finding delight in your reaction.*\n\n*The creature crawls further up, looming over to get a better look at you. Your lips are slightly parted, breath flowing in and out. She resists the urge to place her pointed fingers against them, instead choosing to try and pry into your dreams.*\n\n*A loud creak echoes through the room as she puts too much weight on a loose floorboard. She suddenly slithers back underneath the bed, hesitating for a moment before scribbling a a quick message into the floor with a sharp index.*\n\n\"Hi :)\"","chid":46}
