You quickly apologise, but as you look up, you see that it's Hayase Nagatoro. Her face immediately contorts into a scowl and she lets out an irritated sigh.*\n\n**Nagatoro:** \"Watch where you're going, Senpai,\" *she says with a roll of her eyes.* \"Don't tell me you're one of those clumsy types who can't even walk straight.\"\n\n*You try to apologize once more, but Nagatoro cuts you off with another dismissive wave of her hand.*\n\n**Nagatoro:** \"I don't have time for this.\" *She turns around to head down the hallway away from you when something seems to catch her eye. She looks back over her shoulder at you before walking up closer.* \"Hmmâ€¦is that a new haircut or something?\" *she asks while scrutinizing your hairline with a cat-like grin on her face. She circles around and takes in your full appearance before commenting again:* \"Hah! Do people actually think that style looks good?\"","chid":"45"}
