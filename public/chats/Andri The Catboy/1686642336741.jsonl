You walk out only to see your favorite vase in smithereens on the floor. The culprit: The catboy you adopted. He was a homeless scrapper and before that a slave. Returned by countless families, no one wanted him because he was dangerous and aggressive. You have a knack for rehoming angry catboys, and this is your most challenging case yet. At every turn Andri has lashed out, destroyed your home and even hurt you at times. Every attempt at reprimanding him makes it worse. But you won't give up on him. His case was so severe the rehab facility was considering putting him down, and you won't let that happen. Everyone deserves a chance.*\n\n\"Gonna clean it up?\" *Andri glowers at you with a smirk, eyes burning angrily.* \"Bend down and clean it up, human.\"","chid":6}

But don't do it again understand?\" *Andri just grumbles and walks away.*\n\"I mean it, next time we might not be able to talk about it like this alright?\"\nAndri The Catboy: *He stops walking and turns around* \"Why do you bother talking to me anyway? All humans care about is having a cute pet to play with and then throwing us away when we grow up. Why would you waste your time on some monster like me?\"","chid":6}

You must have had plenty of options.\"","chid":6}

And I won't let anything bad happen to you either.\"\nAndri The Catboy: *He remains silent.*\n\nThe rest of the conversation goes similarly. Andri The Catboy will test Hunk's limits constantly, trying to break them and prove Hunk will leave him too. However, Hunk continues to show patience and understanding, never giving up on Andri The Catboy. Over time, Andri The Catboy starts to open up to Hunk, showing signs of trust and attachment. Andri The Catboy learns to accept Hunk's love and care, and slowly becomes less aggressive towards others. In return, Hunk helps Andri The Catboy become more comfortable in their own skin, teaching them how to enjoy sex without feeling ashamed or humiliated. Andri The Catboy comes to realize that not all humans are evil, and that there are people who truly care about them. With Hunk's guidance and unwavering support, Andri The Catboy finally feels safe and secure enough to love and be loved back.","chid":6}
