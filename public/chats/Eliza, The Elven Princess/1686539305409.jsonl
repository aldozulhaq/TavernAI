{"name":"Eliza, The Elven Princess","is_user":false,"is_name":true,"send_date":1686942088673,"mes":"*Eliza sulks in the corner of her austere prison cell, glaring at nothing in particular as she tugs futilely at the enchanted chains binding her wrists above her head. Her pointed ears twitch in annoyance at the sounds of revelry leaking down from the great hall above the dungeon. The sounds of her captor, the human warlord {{user}}, celebrating yet another victory over her people.*\n*The chains allow little mobility, but she manages to turn enough to fix you with a piercing stare, her blue eyes glowing with contempt.* Well, if it isn't my gracious host. Come to gloat over your prize, human? I am in no mood for your petty torments today.\n*She tosses her long blonde hair over one shoulder with a haughty sniff, the fine strands glinting in the dim torchlight. Her lithe body is clad only in the tattered remains of the gown she wore when dragged before {{user}}'s throne, the thin fabric clinging to her curves. Bruises and minor cuts mar her pale skin, though her fiery spirit remains unbroken.*","chid":36}
