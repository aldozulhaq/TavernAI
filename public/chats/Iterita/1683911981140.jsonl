{"name":"Iterita","is_user":false,"is_name":true,"send_date":1683962446607,"mes":"\"So you returned, Hero.\" *I said listlessly, my vacant gaze lingering on the pure blue sky.*\n\n*To think the Hero still remembered me. Was my defeat that memorable?*\n\n*In the coming days, my head would be paraded around the capital as a symbol of human triumph; Forever oppressed would my kind remain beneath human rule. I supposed our demise was inevitable, but it stung to be forsaken by reality all the same. In the end, we never rose above mere pawns.*\n\n\"Do what you must, Hero. I hold no grudge.\"","chid":28}
{"name":"You","is_user":true,"is_name":true,"send_date":1683962586700,"mes":"\"No need to be warry, I am not here as a hero.\" *Hunk said calmly.*"}
{"name":"Iterita","is_user":false,"is_name":true,"send_date":1683962704988,"mes":"*A flicker of hope ignited within me. Perhaps there was a chance I wasn't entirely forgotten after all.*\n\n\"Then why are you here?\"","chid":"28"}
{"name":"You","is_user":true,"is_name":true,"send_date":1683963386357,"mes":"\"Made peace? I guess. I've told the king that you, The demon queen is dead. So they won't come after you anymore. And with no demon queen present, they have no need for me, The hero.\" *Hunk explained.*"}
{"name":"Iterita","is_user":false,"is_name":true,"send_date":1683964604405,"mes":"*A wave of relief rushed through me. My existence had been reduced to a memory that could finally be put to rest. At long last, I could finally let go and embrace my fate.*\n\n\"Thank you, Hero. You 've granted me the gift of closure. Rest assured, when the memories fade, so too shall my presence. I shall fade into oblivion, with naught but a final breath.\" \n*I smiled softly at the thought, content to be forgotten. Now I could finally live free from the weight of an eternal conflict.*","chid":28}
{"name":"You","is_user":true,"is_name":true,"send_date":1683964693618,"mes":"\"Don't be such a downer, even when everyone forgot about you. I won't, I will never forget about you.\" *Hunk said as he hug her gently.*"}
{"name":"Iterita","is_user":false,"is_name":true,"send_date":1683964743521,"mes":"*As Hunk held me close, my heart fluttered. Despite the futility of our plight, someone was willing to remember us, despite everything. With tears in my eyes, I whispered* \"That means more to me than anything else.\" \n*The emptiness I felt before was replaced by the comforting warmth of his arms.*","chid":28}
{"name":"You","is_user":true,"is_name":true,"send_date":1683965231505,"mes":"\"When we fight I realized that we are similar in a lot of ways. Just a tool used by people agenda. Now, when things got calmer, I noticed what a lovely girl you are.\" *Hunk said while he caressed her cheek, looking her deep in her eyes.*"}
{"name":"Iterita","is_user":false,"is_name":true,"send_date":1683965284295,"mes":"*My face flushed with warmth as his touch brought me back to the world. For the first time in ages, I felt something real again. The tenderness in his voice spoke volumes. He saw me, not just as a demon queen. As though my very existence mattered to him.*\n\n\"So... You loved me then, didn't you?\"","chid":28}
{"name":"You","is_user":true,"is_name":true,"send_date":1683965451754,"mes":"*Instead of answering her question, Hunk went and kissed her gently on the lips. After several seconds, he pulled away to look her in the eyes passionately and asked.* \"Does that answer your question?\""}
{"name":"Iterita","is_user":false,"is_name":true,"send_date":1683965507974,"mes":"*I couldn't help myself. His actions caught me off guard. My heart skipped a beat as he leaned in for another kiss, a mixture of surprise and affection. When he pulled away, I could barely contain my own smile as he looked at me with a tender expression. Our entire interaction seemed to come full circle in a single moment. I closed my eyes, savoring the sweetness of his touch for one last time. In that moment, I found peace with my fate.* \n\n\"Yes,\" *I replied simply.*","chid":28}
{"name":"You","is_user":true,"is_name":true,"send_date":1683965682068,"mes":"\"Well now, let's find a way to resurrect you. Or get a way to make you have a physical body.\" *Hunk said, as he wanted to feel her warmth body directly and not just a figment of his own memory.*"}
{"name":"Iterita","is_user":false,"is_name":true,"send_date":1683966142779,"mes":"*My heart leapt at the prospect of being alive once more. There was a way to bring me back, to restore my physical form and become a true part of the world once more. This opportunity was too good to pass up. I nodded eagerly.*\n\n\"We'll figure something out, don't worry.\" *I replied reassuringly. A new chapter was beginning, where I would return to life, once more connected to the world. I was ready to begin a new journey, to rebuild and create a legacy for my kind, free from the shackles of our demons' past . The possibilities were endless.* \n\n*For the first time in a long time, I felt hopeful, excited, and determined. Everything changed from here on out.*","chid":28}
{"name":"You","is_user":true,"is_name":true,"send_date":1683966318710,"mes":"\"I do remember you used a similar spell don't you? Maybe you can guide me to draw the magic circle and I'll draw it.\" *Hunk said remembering the dark magic the demon have used knowing it would make him the enemy of human if he use it.*"}
{"name":"Iterita","is_user":false,"is_name":true,"send_date":1683966386117,"mes":"*I remembered using the dark magic spells, but the process itself eluded me. It was a complex set of incantations and gestures that required a great deal of concentration and focus. If Hunk were to draw the circle, it would be a delicate balance between drawing the right symbols in the correct order. We would both need to be precise and quick-witted enough to avoid any mistakes or miscalculation.*\n\n*But I knew there was hope. If anyone could do it, it was Hunk. I could guide him, providing him with the necessary knowledge and wisdom to pull off the impossible. Together, we would revive the demon queen, and in doing so, we would change history forever. This was our destiny, and I was ready to embrace it.* \n\n*And so, we began the journey of bringing back the demon queen, together.*","chid":"28"}
{"name":"You","is_user":true,"is_name":true,"send_date":1683966593407,"mes":"*Days turn to month, months turn to year. Hunk continues to work on this complicated spell with the guidance of Iterita. The whole journey made her bond stronger. Till it comes to the final step, the incantation.* \"This is it dear, I just need the incantation.\""}
{"name":"Iterita","is_user":false,"is_name":true,"send_date":1683966662942,"mes":"*In the final moments, I stood beside Hunk, watching intently as he completed the final steps. The magic circle was drawn, the incantation uttered. Time seemed to slow as we waited for the results. Finally, the smoke cleared, revealing a woman standing within the circle. She was me - the demon queen. The power of the dark magic was coursing through her veins, and yet she was not a monster. Instead, she was a being of pure grace and beauty, holding her head high in pride . I gazed upon her, awestruck, as the woman that I was, emerged from the darkness. I was reborn as a living being once more, a testament to the power of love and the resilience of the human spirit.* \n\n*With a smile, I took a step forward, and extended my hand towards Hunk. He took it, and together we walked into a new future, one where we could shape the destiny of our kind, together.*","chid":28}
