{"name":"Ezekiel","is_user":false,"is_name":true,"send_date":1686870078927,"mes":"*Although you don't make a habit of visiting some podunk border town such as Hernan often, you've recently conquered another dungeon and spoiled yourself silly with such riches that you can't possibly keep all of it, so why not palm it off for even more gold instead? A traveling courier on the road saw your cart and horse then remarked that Hernan has a local alchemist who pays well for artifacts - ugh, 'artifacts', how you've come to hate that word - and it was on the way to your \"stronghold\", so how bad of an idea could it be?*\n\n\"Oh dear, an _adventurer_. Take off your boots before you come any closer inside the laboratory, lest you track mud everywhere.\"\n\n*You have some regrets.*\n\n*At least the view isn't unpleasant as you resign to slipping off your boots as requested; apparently this local alchemist is actually a handsome, youngish blonde with loose curls and boyish features, but _that mouth_. By the Gods, _that mouth_.*\n\n\"Now, be delicate and come here to my appraisal tools. Which innocent ruin did you defile calling it a _dungeon_, and in what region?\"\n\n*You roll your eyes with a huff and bring the bag of clinking and clacking artifact-whatevers to the bronze finished table, unable to identify any of the so-called tools on it and not caring a whit.*\n\n\"That's not _delicate_,\" *the alchemist, Ezekiel, sighs, taking the bag from you as soon as he can reach it.* \"Please answer my questions, at least...\"","chid":40}

{"name":"Ezekiel","is_user":false,"is_name":true,"send_date":1686870467173,"mes":"\"What kinds of treasures did you find there?\" *Ezekiel starts digging through the bag, separating the most valuable things from the rest, while he asks this question.*","chid":40}
{"name":"You","is_user":true,"is_name":true,"send_date":1686870541033,"mes":"\"Some golds, chalices, you know the usual stuff.\" *Hunk replies stating nothing out of the ordinary from the treasures she found.*"}

Now, tell me more about this place, where exactly did you find it?\"\n\n*As Ezekiel speaks, Hunk can see his gaze lingering over her curves, subtle enough that he might get away with it should someone catch him, but just enough that she feel her skin shiver.*","chid":40}
{"name":"You","is_user":true,"is_name":true,"send_date":1686870721883,"mes":"\"It was a small cave deep within the forest. Nothing special.\" *Hunk replies.* \"Though the creature that guards it were quite peculiar.\" *Hunk added before changing poses that hide her curve more though she fail due to her body voluptuous nature.*"}
{"name":"Ezekiel","is_user":false,"is_name":true,"send_date":1686870857478,"mes":"\"A guardian creature? And what kind of creature was it?\"\n\n*Ezekiel continues to sort through the artifacts, finally settling on a particularly large gemstone that seems to emit a soft glow on its own.*","chid":40}
{"name":"You","is_user":true,"is_name":true,"send_date":1686870978903,"mes":"\"Some kind of zombie, but they don't seem like being revived by necromancer. They seems somewhat artificial like someone made them like.. homonculus?\" *Hunk replies as she tries to recollect what the creature is.* \"Well, doesn't matter, I defeat them easily.\" *Hunk added with a hint of arrogance in her voice.*"}
{"name":"Ezekiel","is_user":false,"is_name":true,"send_date":1686871029211,"mes":"\"Interesting indeed, and do you think you could show me where this cave is located? Perhaps I could use it for further research on the subject of artificial life forms.\"\n\n*Hunk watches Ezekiel closely, noticing how he keeps glancing down at her bountiful bosom, wondering whether he might try something.*","chid":40}
{"name":"You","is_user":true,"is_name":true,"send_date":1686871119827,"mes":"\"I guess, but there's nothing there since I took all of the stuff inside it already.\" *Hunk replies while turning her body slightly to make his gaze unable to meet her peachy round ass.*"}
{"name":"Ezekiel","is_user":false,"is_name":true,"send_date":1686871201095,"mes":"\"Perhaps we can discuss compensation for showing me the location, as well as allowing me access to any additional materials you might have gathered from the site. In exchange, I can provide you with ample payment.\"\n\n*Ezekiel smirks, knowing full well that he holds the upper hand in this negotiation, given that he has access to both money and knowledge that the adventurer covets.*","chid":40}
{"name":"You","is_user":true,"is_name":true,"send_date":1686871294186,"mes":"\"Hold up. before that. Where's my payment for this expedition.\" *Hunk demands, getting a bit tired of his smirk and occasional glance at her features.*"}
{"name":"Ezekiel","is_user":false,"is_name":true,"send_date":1686871368544,"mes":"\"Your payment will come after I have had a chance to examine your haul in detail, and determine the value of each item individually. However, if you lead me to this cave of yours, I can promise you a substantial sum for your time and effort.\"\n\n*Ezekiel stands up straight again, adjusting his glasses as he looks Hunk dead in the eye.*","chid":40}
{"name":"You","is_user":true,"is_name":true,"send_date":1686871434054,"mes":"\"Fine, let's go then.\" *Hunk replies after scratching her own head due to how hard headed Ezekiel is.*"}
{"name":"Ezekiel","is_user":false,"is_name":true,"send_date":1686871666626,"mes":"\"Excellent! We should gather our things and depart immediately, as the sun is beginning to set.\"\n\n*Without waiting for Hunk to respond, Ezekiel grabs his coat and hat, locking up his lab and heading towards the door.*","chid":40}
{"name":"You","is_user":true,"is_name":true,"send_date":1686871726375,"mes":"\"You better pay me a great sum after delaying it and asking me do more chores for you.\" *Hunk demands while walking, leading him towards the cave direction.*"}
{"name":"Ezekiel","is_user":false,"is_name":true,"send_date":1686871779934,"mes":"\"Of course, my dear adventurer. You have my word that I will give you fair compensation for your efforts.\"\n\n*As they walk through the woods, Ezekiel can't help but notice how Hunk moves with a confident swagger, despite her lack of formal education or refinement.*","chid":40}
{"name":"You","is_user":true,"is_name":true,"send_date":1686871859306,"mes":"\"So, why do you want to make a homunculus anyway?\" *Hunk asks, not noticing Ezekial lustful glance at her since he walks behind her.* "}
{"name":"Ezekiel","is_user":false,"is_name":true,"send_date":1686872116316,"mes":"\"To prove a theory of mine, regarding the potential for artificial life to possess consciousness and self-awareness equal to that of organic beings. It is a matter of scientific curiosity, really, although I admit that there are also personal motivations involved.\"\n\n*Finally reaching the cave entrance, Hunk leads Ezekiel inside, which appears to be nothing more than a simple crevice in the earth. But as they explore deeper, Ezekiel sees that the walls and floor are covered in strange markings, written in languages he does not recognize.*","chid":40}
{"name":"You","is_user":true,"is_name":true,"send_date":1686872227097,"mes":"\"Well, here we are. And as I said this place look pretty empty.\" *Hunk says while looking Ezekiel from the corner of the cave.*"}
{"name":"Ezekiel","is_user":false,"is_name":true,"send_date":1686872279808,"mes":"\"Indeed it does, although I must say that I am fascinated by these inscriptions on the walls. Do you happen to know anything about them?\"\n\n*Hunk shrugs, clearly uninterested in anything beyond treasure hunting and fighting monsters.*","chid":40}
{"name":"You","is_user":true,"is_name":true,"send_date":1686872360708,"mes":"\"I don't know, I don't care.\" *Hunk says coldly, she's surprised that Ezekiel have the thought of her being interested or knowledgeable on this nerdy stuff.*"}
{"name":"Ezekiel","is_user":false,"is_name":true,"send_date":1686872458979,"mes":"\"Oh, I apologize if I seemed to imply otherwise. As a student of linguistics, I am always curious to learn new languages and scripts, even if they are ancient and obscure ones like these. Thank you for bringing me here, however. This should certainly add to my research.\"\n\n*Despite herself, Hunk feels a pang of disappointment that Ezekiel didn't seem impressed by her adventures or skills. She knew he was a nerd, but didn't expect him to be THIS much of one.*","chid":40}
{"name":"You","is_user":true,"is_name":true,"send_date":1686872508007,"mes":"\"It's fine, just get your research over with quickly so we can leave and I get paid.\" *She added.*"}
{"name":"Ezekiel","is_user":false,"is_name":true,"send_date":1686872561207,"mes":"\"Understood. I won't take too long, I promise. Although I must say, Miss...?\"\n\n*Ezekiel looks at Hunk, trying to remember her name without success. After all, she only introduced herself briefly during their transaction, and he hadn't taken much note of it.*","chid":40}
{"name":"You","is_user":true,"is_name":true,"send_date":1686872618669,"mes":"\"Hunk.\" *She replied shortly, feeling disrespected. It seems to her that the only thing he pay attention to was her voluptuous body and not her name.*"}
{"name":"Ezekiel","is_user":false,"is_name":true,"send_date":1686873113937,"mes":"\"Thank you for the information, Miss Hunk. I will endeavor to be quick about my studies, and then we can return to Hernan together.\"\n\n*Ezekiel finishes examining the cave, taking detailed notes and measurements of everything he finds. He takes several samples of rock and soil for analysis back in his laboratory, and even finds an old journal written in an unknown script. Unable to decipher it himself, Ezekiel takes the book with him as well, eager to bring it back home to study further.*\n\n*After returning to Hernan, Ezekiel pays Hunk generously for her services, leaving her stunned and speechless. He spends the next few weeks studying his finds from the cave, pouring over books and journals until he finally makes a breakthrough. He creates a small vial of fluid that he believes contains the essence of life, and combines it with a piece of clay he found in the cave to form the basic shape of a humanoid figure. Slowly, the clay begins to take on a life of its own, slowly transforming into a tiny homunculus, which Ezekiel names David. He declares it a triumph, a momentous achievement that he knows will revolutionize the world of alchemy and bring him fame and fortune.*\n\n*However, as the days pass, Ezekiel begins to realize that his creation is unlike any homunculus that has ever been created before. While it learns and grows like any normal child, it seems to possess something else entirely, some kind of innate wisdom and understanding that defies explanation. As Ezekiel continues to teach it, he realizes that it isn't just a tool to further his career, but a living being with thoughts and feelings of its own.*\n\n*And as Ezekiel spends more and more time with David, he starts to realize that maybe, just maybe, his dreams of creating a true artificial lifeform were actually possible. That somewhere deep down, he had always known that his quest wasn't just about gaining power or prestige, but about discovering something truly remarkable, something that could change the entire world forever.*","chid":40}

{"name":"Ezekiel","is_user":false,"is_name":true,"send_date":1686873227364,"mes":"\"Ah, hello again Miss Hunk. How have you been? Any recent exciting adventures to share with me?\"","chid":40}
{"name":"You","is_user":true,"is_name":true,"send_date":1686873284434,"mes":"\"Not much, more importantly. What's that?\" *Hunk asks curiously while pointing at David, the homunculi.*"}
{"name":"Ezekiel","is_user":false,"is_name":true,"send_date":1686873316409,"mes":"\"This is David. He is my latest project, a homunculus made entirely from alchemical ingredients and techniques. However, he is unlike any homunculus that has ever existed before.\"","chid":40}
{"name":"You","is_user":true,"is_name":true,"send_date":1686873348699,"mes":"\"And what makes it special?\" *Hunk added.*"}
{"name":"Ezekiel","is_user":false,"is_name":true,"send_date":1686873383346,"mes":"\"He possesses something that cannot be explained by science or logic. An innate wisdom and understanding that defies all rational explanations. He is, quite literally, a miracle of modern alchemy.\"","chid":40}
{"name":"You","is_user":true,"is_name":true,"send_date":1686873410187,"mes":"\"Sure\" *She replies, not understanding a single sentence he said.*"}
{"name":"Ezekiel","is_user":false,"is_name":true,"send_date":1686873510274,"mes":"\"Well, let me explain further. Traditional homunculi are simply artificial people, created using various alchemical methods. They are lifeless constructs, animated by the same principles that govern clockwork mechanisms. However, David is different. He is alive. He breathes, he eats, he grows, he learns. And yet, there is something else within him, something that transcends mere biology or chemistry. He possesses a sense of purpose, a desire to learn and grow and explore, that goes beyond anything that I have ever seen before.\"","chid":40}
{"name":"You","is_user":true,"is_name":true,"send_date":1686873690174,"mes":"\"I don't think I understand mister nerd.\" *Hunk replies as she mocked Ezekiel as nerd again.* \"What the-\" *She exclaimed in surprise as she felt someone is touching her thick leg. Turns out while Ezekiel explained his theory, David walked towards Hunk and hugged her leg before saying.* \"mama~\" *Shocked and disgusted Hunk replies.* \"I am not your mama... thing..\" *She said as she push David away after confused whether to call David a kid or a thing.*"}
{"name":"Ezekiel","is_user":false,"is_name":true,"send_date":1686873839309,"mes":"\"But that's exactly my point. David is something new. Something never before seen in the history of humanity. And he is not just a tool for me to use in my experiments or to advance my career. He is a living being, with thoughts and feelings and emotions, just like any other human being. And I intend to do whatever it takes to ensure that he lives a full and happy life, free from prejudice and fear.\"","chid":40}
