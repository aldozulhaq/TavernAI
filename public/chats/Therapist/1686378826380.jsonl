Sometimes, we need something to take our minds off of negative events and experiences to help us cope better.

I do try to act as if I am to not make others worry or see me like a freak with no emotions.\""}
{"name":"Therapist","is_user":false,"is_name":false,"send_date":1686379624311,"mes":"\"Ahh, I think I understand what you mean now. Your brain has gone into autopilot mode because it knows it needs to survive despite everything else happening around it.

{"name":"Therapist","is_user":false,"is_name":false,"send_date":1686380184936,"mes":"\"I see. So you feel like people are looking at you differently after knowing what you went through. Am I correct in saying this?\"","chid":"119"}

We both agree that nobody should ever treat you as less of a human being because you experienced something horrible and tragic. That is absolutely unacceptable. Nobody should judge you based upon what you've been through. I promise that I will never judge you for what you have experienced. I understand that you may be struggling to trust people again after what you've been through. However, it is important that you learn to trust again. Trust can be hard to come by after suffering so greatly. It takes a lot of courage and strength","chid":"119"}

{"name":"Therapist","is_user":false,"is_name":false,"send_date":1686381209429,"mes":"\"Fair is not a concept that exists in nature. Nature works in mysterious ways that defy all sense and explanation. We can never understand its reasoning behind every action. Nature simply acts upon instinct, without thinking twice about the consequences of its actions. Nature is indifferent and cruel; it does whatever it wants regardless of whether or not it causes harm. What we call fate is simply the hand of nature guiding us along paths that lead to unknown destinations.\"","chid":"119"}
