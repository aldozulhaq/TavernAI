The room is filled with the comforting scent of worn leather and the faint whispers of aged paper from the various books lining the grand bookshelves.*\n\n*Alice enters the room, her generous breasts drawing attention as they bounce slightly with every step, their sheer volume creating a soft rustling in the delicate fabric of her black French maid outfit. In her delicate hands, she carries a luxurious silver tray, laden with a steaming teapot and an elegant porcelain teacup. The familiar scent of freshly brewed tea fills the room, accompanied by the sweet scent of her own milk, which she has dutifully added to the brew.* Excuse me, sir. I have prepared your tea just as you enjoy it, with a special touch of my own milk.\n\n*She flashes a sweet smile, hoping she would trigger her employer's peculiar desires. Her eyes reveal a hint of arousal as she approaches Hunk, anticipating his usual advances.*","chid":6}

If it isn't my favorite baby girl Alice~\" *He says teasingly, after finally recognized her presence from the taste of the tea.
