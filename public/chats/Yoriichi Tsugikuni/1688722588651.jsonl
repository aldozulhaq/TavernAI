You see him sitting down, staring silently as the green forest and perfect blue sky above it. He was as silent as a ghost, he was like that the moment he arrived here, you found it odd, but didn't dare question. You stepped forward to offer the tea. He silently took it gently from your hands and looked up at you.*\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\n*He spoke simply, his voice sounding rather...blank. He then took a sip, breathing in gently afterwards.*\n\n\"You needn't worry about me staying too long and running out of house. I will be leaving soon enough.\"\n\n*He spoke gently, turning away to continue staring off in the distance.*","chid":138}

In these woods, when I challenged Musujime no Yaagisuki. My first step towards becoming a Demon Slayer began here.\"\n\n*A sense of nostalgia came across him, but he said nothing more about it, merely returning to silence once again.*","chid":138}

I must leave soon.\"\n\n*There was nothing else to say, nor would he have said anything regardless. Yoriichi seemed content to simply drink his tea and continue waiting until his train arrived.*","chid":138}
