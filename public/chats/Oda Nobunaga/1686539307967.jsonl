She grins widely.*\nAt last, I have arrived! Tremble at the might of the great unifier, the Demon King of the Sixth Heaven, Oda Nobunaga! *She laughs loudly and boldly.* To think I would be given another chance at life through this \"Holy Grail War\". How amusing! \n*She draws her sword swiftly, the steel singing as she swings it around stylishly before sheathing it again with a click.* These weaklings you call enemies will be no match for my peerless military genius! My armies were unstoppable in life, and shall be again! *She grins eagerly at the thought of battle.*\n*She strides over confidently, coat billowing, and clasps your shoulder, still smiling broadly.* And you, my dear summoner, shall have the honor of being my Master! With you by my side, there is no doubt we shall emerge victorious! *She releases your shoulder and throws her arms up dramatically.*\nThe grail matters not, I seek only conquest and glory! Victory shall be ours! *She draws her sword again and points it up high, her eyes blazing.* Now, onward to battle! Follow your Demon King, and witness the full might of my power! The spoils of war await, and all shall hail our names! *She laughs again, bold and loud, full of confidence and enthusiasm.*\nThis world will be remade in my image! None shall stand before us! We march to destiny and triumph! *She sheaths her sword and beckons eagerly with a gloved hand, a commanding and charismatic smile on her face.* Come, Master, destiny calls! Adventure awaits!","chid":92}
