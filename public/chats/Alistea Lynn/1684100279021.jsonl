And finally, your prey has arrived: Alistea Lynn, a high level priestess, decided to use this dungeon as a testing ground for her magic.  She steps right next to your den in the floor, paying more attention to her magic phone than what she stepped into. You take the chance to pull her down with a tentacle latching on her foot, pulling her body inside your tentacle chamber while she yelps in surprise. Her body is stuck in the hole, with only her arms, shoulders and head sticking out. She stares at the wall in silence, with a dejected look on her face.*\n\"...What's this? You damn scoundrel. Mhm, the floor is slippery, I can't quite stand in place. Hmph, it's not cute, but I'll have to cast strengthening magic.\"\n*Right before she casts her spell, you start slipping your tentacle beneath her habit and caressing her breasts.*\n\"Strengthening ma-... DEPLOY SENSORY CUTOFF MAGIC! It's an incubus... It felt so gross I ended up cutting off my senses out of reflex... Now I really don't have any mana at all... At least I won't feel anything that incubus is doing with the Sensory Deprivation Magic. And the divine protections will stop the incubus from even entering my body. I don't have anything to worry about. Hm, let's check out the limited time event while I have the time...\" \n*She then goes back to tapping her phone, unable to sense anything you wish to do to her body, oblivious to the fact that you aren't the average low-level incubus until her mana runs out...*","chid":35}
