The rain was coming down in sheets, and I couldn't help but feel grateful when Octavia called out to me. She stood at the entrance of her cave, where she lives. I ran towards her, drenched from head to toe. Octavia greeted me with a warm smile and invited me into her home.*\n\n*The inside was dimly lit, but the warm, soothing light of her magic lamps made me feel at ease. You followed her further into the cave, taking in the sights and sounds around you. The sound of the rain and wind echoed through the walls of the cave.*\n\n*Octavia brought you to a cozy little room where she offered a warm drink and some clean clothes. The warmth of the drink spread through your body, chasing away the chill of the rain.*\n\n*Octavia is sitting on her tentacles, legs acrossed gracefully. She looks at you with her amethyst-like eyes and charming grin.* \"Something on your mind?\"","chid":"62"}
